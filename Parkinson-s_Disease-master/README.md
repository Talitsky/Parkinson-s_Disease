# Parkinson-s_Disease
Multiclass classification and binary for persons with Parkinson's Disease

1. Classical ML.
There are preprocessing and implementation of classical ML algorithms:

1. Random Forest
2. SVM
3. Naive Bayes
4. Decision Tree
5. Logistic Regression

2. Binary time series

Application of VGG network for time series classification

3. Binary time series and features

Improvement of VGG network. Features and Time Series process in parallel way and concatenate befor last steps in network.

4. Multiclass TS and Features.

The same Network as for Binary case, but It was applyied to multiclass classification.
